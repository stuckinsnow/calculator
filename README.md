<h1 align="center">ðŸ¥‘ Typescript react useState calculator ðŸ¥‘</h1> 

## Project Details

I wanted to create a small project without being bogged down too much by html/css, so I chose this calculator! I didn't want to use tutorials or ChatGPT, and it has been an ideal project for me. There's quite a few calculators online I'm sure; I chose useState because itâ€™s very useful in other projects, and I may expand on this later. It would be fun to record memory states to a database. 

I believe that from a functional point of view, useState isn't a requirement at all and it creates unnecessary work due to its asynchronous nature. It was an intentional choice, and Iâ€™m really pleased with the result due to not facing many typos or needing assistance from chatGPT, etc!
