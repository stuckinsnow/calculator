<h1 align="center">ðŸ¥‘ Typescript react useState calculator ðŸ¥‘</h1> 

## Project Details

I'm a strong believer in repetition for learning, and I wanted to create a small project without being bogged down too much by html/css. I also didn't want to use tutorials or ChatGPT. There's quite a few calculators online I'm sure; I chose useState because itâ€™s very useful in other projects, and I may expand on this project later. It would be kind of fun to record memory states to a database. 

I believe that from a functional point of view, useState isn't a requirement and it creates unnecessary work due to its asynchronous nature. That said, it was an intentional choice, and Iâ€™m really pleased with the result due to not needing ChatGPT 99.99% of the time (I was facing a TypeScript concatination issue, due to converting the number to a string).
